# asp.netTutorial

Asp.net is a framework that allows us to perform simple applications 
in a very complete way implementing the MVC design pattern.

To create our first CRUD in asp.net it is necessary to download visual studio, which we can easily download from the official 
website: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/downloads/Once downloaded and installed, when we open our visual studio for the 
first time, our work interface will appear.
